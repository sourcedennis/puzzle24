# Twenty-Four Puzzles

A Rust library that helps with solving Twenty-Four Puzzles. These are *sliding puzzles* with 24 tiles in a 5x5 grid.

Primarly, it implements *pattern databases* from:

* *Disjoint pattern database heuristics* (2002), by Richard E. Korf and Ariel Felner.

Additionally, we take the sample puzzles from:

* *Finding Optimal Solutions to the Twenty-Four Puzzle* (1996), by Richard E. Korf and Larry A. Taylor

Otherwise, this library contains many low-level optimizations.
